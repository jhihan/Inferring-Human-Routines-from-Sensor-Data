# Inferring-Human-Routines-from-Sensor-Data
This is my practice in the clustering method. 
This project is to reproduce the result from the paper:

This work introduces a approach to model and recognize daily routines such as office work, dinner activities,commuting, lunch routine from wearable sensors. These kinds of high-level routine can be treated as the composition of multiple low-level activities, such as driving bike, driving cart through supermarket, sitting  desk activities, walking while carrying something...etc. These low-level activities can be represented by some features of digital data from sensors.

## Required library  
numpy, matplotlib, pandas, scikit-learn, tomotopy  

## Dataset  
Discovery of Activity Patterns using Topic Models Tam Huynh, Mario Fritz and Bernt Schiele. In Ubicomp'08
